## hi there!
I'm Maakis, a programmer who mainly works with C, C++ and the odd bit of Zig and C3. Mainly interested in low-level computer stuff and hardware.

## main projects:
- [**psyche**](https://github.com/tmkcell/psyche), a 32-bit MIPS-like CPU architecture with a complete emulator and assembler. Currently not open source :(
- [**drisa**](https://github.com/tmkcell/drisa), a 32-bit ISA that aims for high code density, designed as a successor to [psyche](https://github.com/tmkcell/psyche)
- [**gameboff**](https://github.com/tmkcell/gameboff), a gameboy emulator written in C (currently only CPU emulation is complete)
- [**brainzuck**](https://github.com/tmkcell/brainzuck), a brainfuck interpreter written in Zig
